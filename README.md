# WordPres Show Postmeta

I ran into a situation where I was trying to import postmeta and was not sure it was transferring correctly. 
I wrore this plugin to cut down the steps to look up a post's postmeta. With this plugin enabled you can view the postmeta directly on the post edit. 

I am considering adding the ability to edit postmeta from the editor as well.
